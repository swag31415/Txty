# Txty
My very own text editor, built right into the browser. Find it [here](https://swag31415.github.io/Txty/) or as part of [the swag-site](https://swag31415.github.io/Portfolio/). I recommend saving it as your chrome home page and using it for literally everything.

## Features
I'll eventually list them here but it basically does everything you expect and more, just try it out!
